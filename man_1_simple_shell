.SH DESCRIPTION 
juanito is a implementation of standard command interpreter for the system.  The current version of Juanito is 1.0.  This version has many features which make it appear similar
in some respects to the thompson shell, but it is not a thompson shell clone.
This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell. 
.PP
.B Overview

The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets
them, and generally executes other commands.

.PP
.B Invocation

If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal the shell is considered an interactive shell
An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently

The environment variable ENV is set on entry to an interactive shell
To exit of this shell you just need to put 
.B exit

.PP
.B Command Exit Status

Each command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour of other shell com-
mands.  The paradigm is that a command exits with zero for normal or success, and non-
zero for failure, error, or a false indication.

.SH FORMAT 
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream
